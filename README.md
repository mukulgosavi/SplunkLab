SIEM Implementation and Log Analysis

Objective
The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

Skills Learned


Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
Tools Used


Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
